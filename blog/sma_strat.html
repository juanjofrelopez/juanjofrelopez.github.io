            Testing a simple moving average strategy, and having fun with
            optimization

          <p>
            Given a set of stocks with its weekly close prices, and given 3
            moving averages of different sizes (fast, medium and slow), the goal
            is to find the best combination of this parameters that allow a
            stock to accomplish its maximum Compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
          </p>
          <p>The CAGR is a function of the three window sizes:</p>

          <p>$$ CAGR = f(w1,w2,w3) $$</p>
          <p>
            We will also analyze the profitability of the optimal parameters,
            given by:
          </p>
          <p>$$ p=\frac{profitable \space trades}{total \space trades} $$</p>
          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <p>
            The yield function will be maximized according to the CAGR
            parameter, then with the optimal set of window lengths, the
            profitability will be calculated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turns out our problem requires that these rolling window sizes take
            discrete values, which makes sense because a average couldn't be
            taken with a floating point value. When some variables of a function
            are restricted to be integers we are in the realm of "Integer
            programming", which turns out to be NP-complete. At least
            theoretically. Even if our function is NP-hard, we can still manage
            to find an optimal "solution".
          </p>
          <p>
            Since integer linear programming is¬†NP-hard, our problem instances
            are intractable and so heuristic methods must be used instead.
          </p>
          <h2>Experiment settings</h2>
          <p>
            The stocks that we'll be analyzing are from the US market and also
            few others from the Argentinean market represented as ADR's. We will
            maximize our strategy by using the minimizing capabilities of the
            algorithms of scipy. Remember that maximizing a function is equal to
            maximizing its negative:
          </p>
          <p>$$ max[f(x)] = min[-f(x)] $$</p>
          <h2>Analyzing the convexity of our function</h2>
          <p>
            The real blessing here would be to have a function that is convex.
            This implies that the local minima is the same as the global minima.
            And we want convex functions because they are easy to optimize,
            meaning the minimum value is easy to find.
          </p>
          <div class="images">
            <img src="../static/convex_non_convex.png" alt="me" width="70%" />
          </div>
          <p>
            In our case we do not have a mathematically defined function that we
            can use to calculate the yield based on out parameters, so we'll
            have to do it empirically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Analyzing the convexity of a function empirically can be done by
            examining the second-order conditions numerically. For a function of
            two variables, this involves evaluating the Hessian matrix, which
            contains the second-order partial derivatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            $$ \mathbf{H}_f = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial
            x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} \\
            \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2
            f}{\partial x_2^2} \end{bmatrix} $$
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be calculated in a under-performing way by this script:
          </p>

          <pre><code class="lang-py">
def numerical_hessian(f, x, epsilon=1): 
  n = len(x)
  hessian = np.zeros((n, n))
  perturb = np.eye(n) * epsilon 
  for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n): 
      f_x = f(x) 
      f_x_i = f(x + perturb[i]) 
      f_x_j = f(x + perturb[j]) 
      f_x_ij = f(x + perturb[i] + perturb[j]) 
      hessian[i, j] = (f_x_ij - f_x_i - f_x_j + f_x) / (epsilon ** 2) 
  return hessian
            </code></pre>

          <p>
            Where <code>n</code> is a point that has both values for the window
            sizes <code>[w1,w2]</code> The <code>epsilon</code>
            parameter is a small value used to compute the finite differences.
            But in this case window size values can only be integers, so it
            equals to one. I don't really know or have clear how this affects
            this algorithm.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the simulation (testing only with one stock ticker) with
            values for <code>w1</code> from 20 to 35 and <code>w2</code> from 40
            to 60, we get 47 points where the Hessian is positive semi-definite
            and 289 where the Hessian is NOT positive semi-definite.
            <b>So we can conclude that our function is non-convex.</b> This
            means that it has regions where it is convex and regions where it is
            not. Non-convex functions can have multiple local maxima or minima,
            making optimization more challenging. Libraries like
            <a href="https://www.cvxpy.org/" target="_blank">CVXPY</a> or
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization" target="_blank"
              >OR Tools</a
            >
            which have integer programming capabilities, may not be suitable for
            this problem. We now have to consider optimization methods designed
            for non-convex problems.
          </p>
          <h2>Finding global minima with experimental methods</h2>
          <p>
            After some research i decided to try the
            <code>differential_evolution</code>
            method that scipy provides. This algorithm is classified as "meta
            heuristics" since no assumption is made about the function to
            optimize. The premise is to have "candidate solutions" that are
            moved around the n-dimensional space and eliminated if not
            improvement was made. This allows us to find a solution that will be
            satisfactory in some sense, although there's no guarantee of
            arriving at it. Also this method is great because it allows us to
            establish that the parameters will be integers with the
            <code>integrality</code> parameter.
          </p>
          <p>The optimization is done in this way:</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-python"
              >
bounds = [(5, 15), (20, 35), (40, 60)] 
x0 = np.array([10, 30,
50]) 
stop_loss = 0.1 
result = sp.optimize.differential_evolution(
  objetive_function, bounds, integrality=[True, True, True],
  args=(df, stop_loss), x0=x0)
              </code
            >
          </pre>
          <p>
            Based on a bunch of different stock, both from the US market and
            also Argentinean adr's the simulation gives us this results. We need
            to have in mind that only weekly close prices are used in this
            strategy to avoid entering into the realms of noisy data and its
            altercations.

          <h2>Adding a stop loss parameter</h2>
          <p>
            Now we'll change the strategy a bit by means of a stop loss setting.
            In this case it was set at 10% of the bought price. Once again
            running the simulation gives us these results:

          <p>
            We see that by adding a simple stop loss measure we achieved a far
            superior robustness in our results not only in CAGR's but in
            profitability too. What I find particularly interesting is that the
            extreme tails in the distributions were cutoff and the profitability
            is now almost certainly above the 50% level.
          </p>

          <h2>The final approach: Setting the stop loss as a parameter</h2>
          <p>
            Now for the final round of tests we will include the stop loss as a
            parameter in our objective function. The range of action will be
            between 1 and 20 percent.
          </p>

          <p>The histograms result in something like this:</p>
          <div class="images">

            And the table with final results including the definitive stop loss
            values go like this:
